Language tutor app by Gabriella Bona and Bendeg√∫z Tajti

## What have we learnt?
- usage of MVP Architecture
- usage of `Room` persistence library
- use `Fragments`
- use `AsyncTask`
- utilize the localization feature in Android Studio with japanese and english language


## Usage of the app:
In this app you can add language cards to practice with. If you don't provide the translation to a word, the system will search for the matching word and find it either in japanese or in english. After you have added the card you can start to practice them, each time the system will inform you which words did you fail to learn.
